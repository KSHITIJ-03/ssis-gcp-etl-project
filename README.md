# GCP Data Migration via SSIS

This project involves designing and executing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to migrate enterprise data from on-premise databases to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## ðŸ’¼ Project Context
This project aims to modernize legacy on-premise data systems by migrating structured data to cloud-based infrastructure on GCP. The work includes building SQL-based ETL pipelines, applying transformations, and ensuring data integrity during the migration process.

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- T-SQL / SQL queries
- OLE DB connections
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## ðŸ”„ ETL Workflow Highlights
- Built multiple Data Flow pipelines with Lookup transformations, OLE DB Sources & Destinations
- Applied star schema design principles using fact and dimension tables
- Performed type conversions, data cleansing, and column mapping
- Validated data accuracy post-migration using SQL scripts

## ðŸ“¦ Output
- Created clean and structured cloud-ready destination tables
- Automated transformation processes via SSIS packages
- Ensured consistent, accurate data for cloud analytics and reporting

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- Practical exposure to data engineering and cloud migration concepts
- End-to-end ETL pipeline creation and optimization
- Real-world experience in troubleshooting data flows and transformation logic
